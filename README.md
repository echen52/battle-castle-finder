# Battle Castle Pokemon Finder

A web-based tool for identifying possible Pokemon opponents in Pokemon Platinum and HeartGold/SoulSilver's Battle Castle facility based on observed characteristics.

## Features

- **Game Version Support**: Toggle between HGSS and Platinum input orders
- **Multi-Search System**: Search up to 3 Pokemon simultaneously using different criteria
- **IV Modes**: Toggle between 31 IV and 21 IV calculations for accurate speed stat predictions
- **Smart Autocomplete**: Type-ahead suggestions for Items, Natures, Abilities, and Pokemon names
- **Visual Pokemon Display**: Sprite images for easy identification
- **Detailed Movesets**: View complete movesets, abilities, items, and speed stats for each match
- **Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes during long Battle Castle sessions

## How to Use

### Game Version Selection
- **HGSS Mode** (Default): Input order is Ability → Nature → Item
- **Pt Mode**: Input order is Item → Nature → Ability

The interface automatically rearranges based on your selection to match the game you're playing.

### IV 31 Mode (Default)
Search using any combination of:
- **Ability** (e.g., Intimidate, Pressure)
- **Nature** (e.g., Adamant, Modest)
- **Item** (e.g., Choice Band, Leftovers)

All three search slots work the same way in this mode.

### IV 21 Mode
- **Search 1**: Same as IV 31 mode (Ability/Nature/Item)
- **Search 2 & 3**: Enter Pokemon name only - returns Instance 4 of that Pokemon

### Search Tips
- You don't need to fill all fields - partial searches work fine
- Use autocomplete suggestions for accurate spelling (dark-themed dropdown)
- Results show all matching Pokemon with their complete movesets
- Speed stat updates automatically based on IV selection
- Input field order changes based on game version for easier matching

- Browser autocomplete limited to 10 suggestions per query for performance
- Dataset specific to Battle Castle facility (not Battle Tower/Factory/etc.)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why does the input order change?**  
A: HGSS and Platinum use different display orders for Pokemon info. The tool matches what you see in-game.

**Q: What's the difference between IV 31 and IV 21?**  
A: IV 31 is max IVs and standard for higher rounds. Any battle past Battle 49 is associated with Round 8. However, the Battle Castle also occasionally selects a trainer from the previous round. In this case, Round 7 Trainers are associated with IV 21, and therefore sometimes will appear.
