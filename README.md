# Battle Castle Pokemon Finder

A web-based tool for identifying possible Pokemon opponents in Pokemon Platinum's Battle Castle facility based on observed characteristics.

## Features

- **Multi-Search System**: Search up to 3 Pokemon simultaneously using different criteria
- **IV Modes**: Toggle between 31 IV and 21 IV calculations for accurate speed stat predictions
- **Smart Autocomplete**: Type-ahead suggestions for Items, Natures, Abilities, and Pokemon names
- **Visual Pokemon Display**: Sprite images for easy identification
- **Detailed Movesets**: View complete movesets, abilities, items, and speed stats for each match

## How to Use

### IV 31 Mode (Default)
Search using any combination of:
- **Item** (e.g., Choice Band, Leftovers)
- **Nature** (e.g., Adamant, Modest)
- **Ability** (e.g., Intimidate, Pressure)

All three search slots work the same way in this mode.

### IV 21 Mode
- **Search 1**: Same as IV 31 mode (Item/Nature/Ability)
- **Search 2 & 3**: Enter Pokemon name only - returns Instance 4 of that Pokemon

### Search Tips
- You don't need to fill all fields - partial searches work
- Use autocomplete suggestions for accurate spelling
- Results show all matching Pokemon with their complete movesets
- Speed stat updates automatically based on IV selection
